## Tool for batch merging video files with subtitles into mkv files ##

TwoTone is a python script which searches for movie and subtitle files and merges them into one mkv file.<br />
**Be aware that source files will be deleted** so you may want to backup your data.

By default subtitles are added without any language label but it can be changed with \-\-language option. See \-\-help for details.
