### Available tools

#### Merging video files with subtitles into mkv files 

twotone.py is a python script which searches for movie and subtitle files and merges them into one mkv file.<br/>
By default subtitles are added without any language label but it can be changed with \-\-language option. <br/>
See \-\-help for details.


#### Automatic video reencoding

encode.py takes video dir as an input parameter and reencodes them with x265 coded.<br/>
Script tries to find optimal crf for each video by comparing original video with encoded one and measuring quality.
As of now it looks for crf giving SSIM â‰ˆ 0.98 result. 

Currently this is a very simple script. It has no 'dry run' mode no any other options. Just run it with the input dir.<br/>
Please mind ctrl+c is not supported yet, so be careful when you stop its work.
