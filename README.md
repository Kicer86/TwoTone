### Merging video files with subtitles into mkv files 

twotone.py is a python script which searches for movie and subtitle files and merges them into one mkv file.<br/>
By default subtitles are added without any language label but it can be changed with \-\-language option. <br/>
See \-\-help for details.


### Automatic video transcoding

transcode.py takes video directory as an input parameter and transcodes all found videos with x265 codec.<br/>
Script tries to find optimal CRF for each video by comparing original video with transcoded one and measuring quality using SSIM method. <br/>
By default value of 0.98 (0.0 รท 1.0) is used, as desired quality, but this can be changed with command line parameters.
